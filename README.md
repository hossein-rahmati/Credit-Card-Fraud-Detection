# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This repository contains the implementation of a machine learning pipeline for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions. The project leverages common data science libraries to preprocess data, train multiple models, and evaluate their performance using appropriate classification metrics.

> **Note:** The dataset used for this project is **not included in the repository** due to its large size. However, you can download a similar publicly available dataset from [Kaggle - Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud).

## Project Overview

Fraud detection is a critical task in the financial sector. This project demonstrates building a robust fraud detection model using supervised learning techniques. It includes the following components:

- **Data preprocessing**
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Model training using Random Forests**
- **Model evaluation with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and MCC**
- **Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation**
